I have finally completed the first stage of my CLI project.  There will be considerable refactoring, I'm sure, but I at least have a functioning project.  After a few false starts, and bouts of frustration, I am happy to have made it this far.  It might not be perfect, and it might not be very advanced, but I am satisfied, nonetheless.

My project is a curling iron review.  Initially, I planned to do a theater listing project where you would type in your zip code and then have a list of theaters in your area.  From there you would be able to select a theater and see the movies and showtimes playing at the selected theater.  I chose Fandango as the site to scrape, and it proved to be a little more than I could handle.  If it is scrapable, it is beyond my current skill level.  I struggled to to scrape what I needed to scrape, and ultimately hit a wall.  I thought I could perhaps try to salvage what I had by choosing another site - another movie site, or even a vet clinic listing, or red box listing, and so on.  Each site I came across seemed to have a little more complexity than I was looking for.  I would suggest to anyone starting this project to look at sites first.  If you build a project around a site that is not scrapable, or at least not easily scrapable, it will set you back to the beginning.  

For my project, a full list of 20 of the top rated curling irons is listed for the user.  Then, the user chooses which curling iron from the list they want to inspect further.  They can then drill down to see the product description and the listed benefits of the product.  The page I used was a lot easier to scrape, but I still struggled at the beginning with determining the class and selecting the right attributes.  After going back through the previous scraping labs, and receiving some guidance from my cohort lead, I was able to get it.  More importantly, I am a lot more comfortable with scraping.  I'm not great at it, and I still had to make to changes to my project due to what I could figure out how to scrape, but more comfortable than when I started.  

Not that I have at least made it this far, I am tempted to try another project just for practice.  I would like to revisit my initial project - having the user enter a zip code to search for nearby businesses, or products.  I will have to find a site that is more my speed, but I'm sure there is one out there.
