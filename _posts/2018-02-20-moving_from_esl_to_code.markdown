I have a strong background in linguistics - B.A and M.A, and even though there is a unique relationship between theoretical linguistics and aspects of computer science, I never actually learned how to code.  I have been trying for some time now to learn, but never got very far.  At this point though, I am ready to dive in and see how my new skills can lead to a new career without abandoning my love of language.  

I have been working in ESL for many years in both the teaching and administrative side.  I have taught in Canada, Japan and now the U.S.  Although I love teaching, and I love working with students and seeing them acheive their language goals, I know that the brick and mortor school environment is not where I see myself 5-10 years down the road.  It is an industry that offers students a lot of different options, but still ultimately serves a select few.  I am interested in moving into a role that builds self-paced language learning, and is accessible to many more people.  Learning how to code will not only allow me to one day move into such a role, but will hopefully open up a wide range of future opportunities.
