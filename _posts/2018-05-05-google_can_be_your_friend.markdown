I have been stuck on the Cash Register Lab for a few days now, but I have at least made some progress.  As per usual, when I am stuck, I first look online for hints and previous solutions to help me along.  It feels good to be able to have a solution, but this approach raises a few questions in regards to my progress.  I know it is encouraged to "look it up" when trying to solve a lab, but to what extent should I be relying on another solution/similar solution to help me out?  In the long run, am I really learning, or just "copying"?  Here is how I come to terms with it:

1)  Learn through example:  I need to see an example and how it works.  Especially at this stage when I am still getting my footing.  If I can see how an example solution works, and I can take my time to try to process it through, then it is positively affecting my learning at the end of the day.

2)  Refactoring: Some example solutions that I have come across seem to be too complicated.  I have successfully refactored solutions which is progress of a kind.  If I understand enough to be able to refine the code, then that is a testament to my learning success.  

3)  Know when to walk away:  At times, there are solutions that make zero sense to me, and I am left going, "I would never in a million years even come close to being able to do that on my own."  When that thought enters my head, I know it is time to turn to the good people at Flatiron to help me out.  

All in all, I am proud of what I have accomplished this far.  There are labs that I knock out without a problem, and others that leave me scratching my head and looking for outside resources to point me to where I need to go.  As long as I am doing my best to understand/try to understand what is going on, I am really learning.
