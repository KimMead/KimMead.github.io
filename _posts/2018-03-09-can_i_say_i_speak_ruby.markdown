I was thinking about doing a blog entry on my recently completed Tic Tac Toe game, but I need a little bit of a break from it.  I'm excited to go back through it in detail for my own learning purposes, but not right now.  So, I decided to go with the suggested topic on disucssing a relationship between code and another aspect of my life.  Since I am currently an academic director for an ESL school with a solid background in formal and theoretical linguistics,  I thought I would write a bit about language vs., well, "language".  Here are just a few thoughts on that comparison based on my albeit novice experience with code.  Obviously, not an exhaustive conversation on the matter:

First and foremost, programming languages are creative but a little less forgiving.  Just like human languages, there are many ways to get the same message across.  The same information, or #method can be expressed, or written, in many different ways.  In both, there is a degree of accuracy required in order to successfully get your desired message across, but attention to detail and formula is a lot more important for a computer.  That "hail mary" element isn't quite the same in programming - it isn't a matter of throwing out the right keywords and having the recipient fill in the grammatical gaps themselves based on contextual clues.  The computer can't do that.  Instead, the code breaks and you have to keep trying until it is actually right.  

Learning a programming language is also having to learn how to have a different kind of conversation.  Of course, there isn't the same kind of interplay with a program.  There isn't the same kind of response anticipation, and back and forth construction.  Instead, the tests either pass or fail, and the code either produces the desired outcome or not.  I like to think of my failed tests as the program's facial expressions - furrowed brow, or a blank/deer in the headlights look when I tell it something it doesn't understand.  There is a kind of communication there, but obviously not like natural language.  At least not healthy communication by our standards.  

There is a lot to be said about the overall concept of language in this context.  Happy to hear your thoughts :)
